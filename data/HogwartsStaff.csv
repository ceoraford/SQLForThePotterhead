Cuthbert Binns|History of Magic|The History of Magic teacher for the entire series, Cuthbert Binns has the distinction of being the only teacher at Hogwarts who is a ghost. It is said that one day he took a nap in a chair in the staff room and died in his sleep later, he simply got up to go to teach his next class and "left his body behind". His lessons are notoriously boring and it is mentioned that the most exciting thing that ever happens in his class is his "entering through the blackboard". As a ghost, he seems unaware of his change from living to dead. In the second book, it is he who describes the legend of the Chamber of Secrets when asked by the students, but in the film version, it is McGonagall, as Binns does not appear in any of the films. He constantly gets the students' names wrong and is often so absent-minded he is amazed to find the class filled with students.
Charity Burbage|Muggle Studies|The Muggle Studies teacher before Harry's seventh year she does not appear until Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (as Harry has no need to take the class). Because her teachings about Muggles gave an overall favourable impression of them, going so far as to write an editorial praising Muggles in the Daily Prophet, she runs afoul of the Death Eaters, whose philosophy asserts the supremacy of pure-bloods. She becomes a prisoner of Lord Voldemort in the seventh book; he tortures and kills her before feeding her to Nagini. The character (played by Carolyn Pickles) appears briefly in the film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1.
Amycus Carrow|	Muggle Studies / Deputy Headmaster | Posted as Deputy Headmaster to Hogwarts to keep control over the school, maintain a reign of fear and to take charge of punishment under Severus Snape's regime as Headmaster in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Alecto Carrow taught Muggle Studies, now a required course; however, instead of encouraging understanding of Muggles,she taught ideologies that Muggles were no better than animals. Amycus Carrow taught Defence Against the Dark Arts; however it is noted that there was no defence involved because they had changed the name to Dark Arts, so Amycus frequently taught students the Unforgivable Curses and openly encouraged them to practice these on their classmates who earned themselves detention. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Alecto Carrow is stunned by Luna Lovegood in the Ravenclaw common room. Harry Potter then uses the Cruciatus Curse on Amycus Carrow after he spat in Minerva McGonagall's face.
